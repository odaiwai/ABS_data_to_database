# Build a sqlite database from the downloaded ABS data

The ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) produces and coherent set of
downloads containing the heirarchical Geographical segmentation of Australia,
and also published the census to match these same boundaries.  This
heirarchical system decsribes each state and territory from the single entity
down to approximately street blocks (or equivalent).

This current build uses the 2011 data, however it should work for the 2016 and
subsequent data also.
